# Running this bot

The p5 web editor will not accept uploads of RiveScript files (files with the .rive extension), which means you'll need to serve this sketch locally.

1. Download the repo files as a [].zip archive](https://github.com/nopivnick/itp_catn_chatbot/archive/master.zip)
2. Unpack the archive
3. Open terminal and cd to the root of the new directory of files
4. While in that directory, run the web server of your choice locally.
5. Open a web browser and visit localhost

On a mac, cd to the new directory and start a simple http server in Python:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

then visit http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.
